This is a set of tools for use on gameday.

The folks at [WarHorn](https://www.warhorn.net) have done a fantastic job of creating a tool which is great for organizing and keeping track of events before gameday. When our group switched to WarHorn from our previous homebrew system there were a couple of features we were sacrificing. This is an attempt to bring those features with us to WarHorn.

Features:
- A unified web interface which will list all upcoming events as well as who has signed up for each (GM and players).
- An e-mail notification can be sent to the GM right before game time so (s)he knows who to expect at the table.
